# codeGPT.App

Prompt Engineering takes time and the templates once created will always work. This is a "codeGPT" where we can configure our Development Standards and a custom User Message.
We then select the Model, Interface, Service, Controller, Overrides, and Startup files that correctly meet your implementation.
ChatGPT4 will now respond saying "Hi, my name is codeGPT. What are we coding today?" and you can give it the same instructions you would give to any Senior Developer.
